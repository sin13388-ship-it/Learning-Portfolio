   //For lower pin-count packages, some pins may be unbonded.
   //These pins should be properly configured to avoid extra current
   //consumption caused by floating inputs.
   //Please refer to the "Standby Current Considerations" and
   //"Input/Output Ports" sections in the datasheet for details.
